## PRIVACY POLICY
TurboRAM exists only to help your computer run smoothly. It does not track you, share any data, or even connect to the internet. I built this app to solve a problem that I see people facing every day. I am not interested in your data, and I don't like unnecessary tracking.

## SUPPORT
I take all feedback consideration to continually improve your experience, and answer emails within 24 hours at most. You can email me at [turboram@ksapps.com](mailto:turboram@ksapps.com).

## CONTRIBUTING
If you want to improve the app, feel free to submit a PR and I'll have a look :D
